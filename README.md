My attempt at a Ludum Dare gamejam. Starting with 40 hours remaining

The theme is "Small World". I'm going to use this to create a mechanic where you can grow your character with a special ability. This should then be used to get through the levels.
The game is going to be a 2D sidescroller with pixel programmer art. At the moment I am planning the game so I know what to do.
