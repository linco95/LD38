# LD38
My attempt at a Ludum Dare game jam. Starting with 40 hours remaining

The theme is "Small World". I'm going to use this to create a mechanic where you can grow your character with a special ability. This should then be used to get through the levels.
The game is going to be a 2D sidescroller with pixel programmer art. At the moment I am planning the game so I know what to do.

# Goals and expectations
I want to use this game jam to get a small, short, project from start to finish. It doesn't really matter if the game itself turns out to be that great, as long as it is playable and has an end.
The current goal is to get a game with one character, some tile that can hurt/kill that character and the ability to shrink the world. There should be a main menu, one level and a game over/won screen.
